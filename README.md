This README provides an overview of the upcoming project, a Smart Locker System, which combines hardware and software to create a modern and efficient solution for locker management.
The project integrates a React Native application with a hardware locking mechanism powered by a Raspberry Pi and solenoid locker.

Project Overview:
The Smart Locker System project aims to revolutionize locker management by providing a seamless and user-friendly experience.
Users can conveniently rent and access lockers using a React Native application, which interacts with the hardware components to control locker access.

Features:
React Native Application: The heart of the project is a React Native application that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the locker system.
The application allows users to browse available lockers and rent them.

QR Code Integration: Users can rent lockers by scanning a QR code on the locker itself using the React Native application. 
This process streamlines the rental process and ensures secure access.

Raspberry Pi & Solenoid Locker: The locking mechanism is established through a Raspberry Pi, which controls a solenoid locker. 
The Raspberry Pi receives commands from the React Native application to lock and unlock specific lockers, ensuring secure storage for users' belongings.

How It Works:
Users open the React Native application and browse available lockers.
Users visit the physical locker and scan the QR code using the application.
The React Native application sends a command to the Raspberry Pi to unlock the corresponding locker.
Users can now access the locker, securely store their belongings, and lock the locker using the application.

Once the project is completed i will upload it!
